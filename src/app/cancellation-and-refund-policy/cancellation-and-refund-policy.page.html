  therefore a liberal cancellation policy. Under this policy: <br><br>
  • Cancellations will be considered only if the request is made immediately after placing the order.
  However, the cancellation request may not be entertained if the orders have been communicated to the
  vendors/merchants and they have initiated the process of shipping them.<br><br>
  • BELLYJOY FOODS PRIVATE LIMITED does not accept cancellation requests for perishable items
  like flowers, eatables etc. However, refund/replacement can be made if the customer establishes that the
  quality of product delivered is not good.<br><br>
  • In case of receipt of damaged or defective items please report the same to our Customer Service team.
  The request will, however, be entertained once the merchant has checked and determined the same at his
  own end. This should be reported within Only same day days of receipt of the products. In case you feel
  that the product received is not as shown on the site or as per your expectations, you must bring it to the
  notice of our customer service within Only same day days of receiving the product. The Customer
